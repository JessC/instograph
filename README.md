# instograph
provides users of Instagram additional features not available through the native app

This is is nothing new or groundbreaking but a way to continue to push myself as a developer. My goal was to learn new things and solidify things I already know. Since I'll be spending many hours on this it's also important to have fun.

I saw a Facebook, a non technical friend had recently discovered the DOM. They posted a message on explaining how they were able to find direct links to instagram pictures and then download them. 
I thought I should just make an app that can show pictures and include a download button!
In real life I almost never use Instagram, in fact I'm trying to taper off my social networking a bit and spend more time outside since much of my time is spent coding. This would be a good way to learn and be cyber social.

My main goal was to deploy a Ruby on Rails application with Amazon Web Services. I have used Heroku in the past to successfully deploy applications. I never really took the time to figure out whats going on. As long as it automagically works I was good. 
AWS has forced me to understand the architechture involved in a deployed application including databases, servers, storage, and so on. I've used Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, EC2, and S3.
S3 has been the hardest of the technologies. While I had it working in the Development environment fairly easy, Production has proved to be difficult. At one point it worked and since I had files stored locally and on S3 I decided to drop the database. Then it stopped working :( (I'll take a break from it and go back later)

OAuth was something I had little experience with and at first it was a little hard to wrap my head around. Even before programming, I wondered how it worked so I provided a simple explanation on the homepage for the users.

Bootstrap was something that I personally never touched. I have been involved with group projects using it though. I decided to make the navigation bar with it.

API's. I knew Instagram provides excellent documentation so that's another bonus for choosing this project. Google Maps API is like CSS theres so much you can do with it, you really have to use some self control to not get carried away. I'll wait till future apps to do more.

Getting used to Rails. To be honest, before starting this app, I was more comfortable in Sinatra. So improving my fluency in Rails was actually a big goal.
