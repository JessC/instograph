	<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Welcome to the first draft. I'll continue to add features as time permits. At this point, not even sure what I want this to turn into, I have some ideas but for now it basically plots your instagram pics on a map...if you've tagged their location. You can also upload photos. It's completely anonymous so there's no user and anyone can delete any photo.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5em;">
	The 'About' page has a list of things I'm working on, and most of the technologies I've used.</p>

	<h3>Signing In...how does that work? Is it safe?</h3>
	<p>To use the map portion you need to sign into your instagram account. To do this I use <a href="http://oauth.net/" target="_blank">oauth</a> You've seen it before if a sites asked you to log in through FB, G+, LinkedIn, etc... It basically allows my site to access minimal information from your account. It doesn't keep anything, it just uses my code to display your information in a particular way. It's the same information any of your friends can see by going on your Instagram account. You can see exactly what information that is <a href="https://instagram.com/accounts/manage_access/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
	<p>
	What about my login information you ask?...Well, as long as you trust Instagram...this site doesn't handle login information. I'll try to simplify the best I can: 
</p>
<p>
	In order for this all to work I had to pre-register my information with Instagram. You can do it too. It's free, just go <a href="https://instagram.com/developer/" target="_blank">here</a>. <br> So, they give me some secret codes to use which I then need to use in my code. When you go to sign in, it's actually sending my codes to Instagram. If everything checks out and I haven't abused my privledges (there's rules), they display a page for you to enter your login information. This page is provided by instagram, not me! (You can see the URL changes to instagram.com when signing in). When you click submit Instagram checks to see that you have an account with them. Then they send my page an authentication code for your session. So whenever my page requests information from Instagram, it also sends the authentication code which represents you so it knows what information to get. Logging out or deleting browser history deletes the access token...which is completely useless outside of this application on your computer anyway.</p>
